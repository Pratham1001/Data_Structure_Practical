## Polynomial Addition

Node{
    coefficient, degree, next(Node*)
}
Determination of larger Polynomial will save time though,
saving just value with increasing degree will reduce a variable,
but increase space for degree with 0 coefficient.
## Sparse Matrix
[
    [0,0,0,0,5],[0,0,0,0,5],[0,0,0,0,5],[0,0,0,0,5],[0,0,0,0,5]
]
represent in linked list of following type.
Node{
    row, col, val, next(Node*)
}
